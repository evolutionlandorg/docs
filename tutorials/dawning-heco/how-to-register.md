# How to register?

DAWNING Continent, the fourth Continent on the Evolution Land, is based on the Huobi ECO Chain. HT is the cryptocurrency used in the DAWNING, and its value fluctuates with the market.

Players need to convert fiat money \(US dollars, Canadian dollars, Pounds, etc.\) into HT to pay for gas in the DAWNING - such as buying RING, buying land, etc.

Players cannot use fiat money to purchase RING or other assets on the Evolution Land - the fiat money needs to be converted to HT first.

Players can withdraw RING to Heco address through Huobi exchange, or purchase HT from the exchange that supports the purchase of cryptocurrency and then transfer HT from exchange to address which used to register Evolution Land.

There are two ways to register the DAWNING on the Evolution Land: Web and Mobile. Please choose your preferred and appropriate way to register:
