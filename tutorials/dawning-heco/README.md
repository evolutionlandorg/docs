# Dawning - Heco

Evolution Land is a virtual simulation blockchain game, and Dawning Continent, the fourth Evolution Land Continent, is based on the Heco Chain. Therefore, it will be very helpful for you to know something about Heco in advance.

## What is Heco？

Huobi ECO Chain \(Heco\) is a decentralized, high-efficiency, and energy-saving public chain, also the first product launched by the Huobi Open Platform. It is compatible with smart contracts and supports high-performance transactions. The endogenous token of Heco is HT and it adopts the HPoS consensus mechanism.

## What is HT？

The endogenous token on the chain is HT; the transactions burn HT as gas fee. Miners pledge HT to become validator nodes. The reward of nodes is gas fee, which is distributed according to the mortgage proportion.

## What is HecoScan？

[HecoScan](https://scan.hecochain.com/) is a query tool on the Huobi ECO chain. It can tell the player what happened on the blockchain, it can also help the player verify the success of the transaction, and track other useful details about the transaction and address.

## What is Gas?

Dawning Continent \(Continent D\) is based on the HECO Chain. "Gas" is a short term used to describe the cost of a transaction or contract on Huobi ECO chain.

The blockchain is decentralized, each transaction is distributed on multiple computers, rather than on a central server. The cost of Gas is paid for a large amount of computing power.

The gas consists of two parts: gas price and gas limit.

Gas Price is the amount of ether offered per gas unit to pay miners to process your transaction.

“Gas Limit” sets the maximum amount of computational power you’ll allow the miner to use before they top out and stop processing your request. 1 Gwei = 1/1000000000 HT。

Players can check the current situation on [https://hecoinfo.com/chart/gasprice](https://hecoinfo.com/chart/gasprice) to select the appropriate fee.

## I lost access to my wallet, can you recover my assets?

Unfortunately, we can't. This is not because our policy doesn't allow us. It's because smart contracts on the blockchain secure all the assets. Your private key is the only thing to unlock and use your assets. We have no power to edit or reallocate assets owned by users.
