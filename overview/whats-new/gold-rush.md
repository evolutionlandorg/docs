# Are you ready for 'The Gold Rush?'

Inhabitants of Evolution Land are eager explorers! Whenever a new continent is discovered, there are some who choose to abandon their comfortable lives and donate their lands back to EVE, in hopes of exchanging them for new and abundant lands on the new continent. EVE then selects the best candidates to become Explorers and Pioneers; who undertake the journey and settle on the new lands.

Based on the construction of the Heco chain, Dawning Continent has a series of advantages such as high TPS and low handling fees. In addition to these advantages, the Dawning Continent will be the first to launch the farm (add a liquidity pool to obtain RING rewards) function, so what are you waiting for!

## Gold Rush Start:

The first Gold Rush event of Evolution Land will officially start on 28th, June, 2021. The registration time for the event will last for 7 days! Players who own lands on Atlantis(Ethereum) and Byzantine(Tron) can participate in this event!

We reserved 20 lands on the Dawning Continent for migration.
