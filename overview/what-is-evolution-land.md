# What is Evolution Land

Evolution Land is a virtual simulation blockchain game that supports cross-chain interactions. The game will have up to 26 continents, each of which is deployed on a different public chain. Two continents have been built so far and have been deployed on Ethereum \(Atlantis Continent\) and Tron \(Byzantine\). The governance parameters, such as the trade tax rate, will be set by players. Users can buy and sell the land and have apostles to mine precious elements, perform construction work, manufacture equipment, etc. Apostles may have offspring inherit or mutate their genes and improve their abilities by upgrading their talents and gear. There is a miner in career choices and warrior, architect, musician, doctor, and many others. Different continents will evolve into independent countries, and there will be trades and wars between the nations through the cross-chain technology powered by Darwinia Network.

Evolution Land integrates various gameplays, including management, collection, education, gene, battle, auction, and game, which will continuously be evolving.

Different from traditional games, gaming logic is written in smart contracts and deployed on various blockchains. There're no black boxes. Game UI is a separate layer. Anyone can develop their own UI or tools to interact with the game. Fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens are used extensively in Evolution Land. Any interactable game entity is either FT or NFT, truly owned by players and secured by underlying blockchain technology.

## Gameplays

**NFT Collectibles:** There are unique features and as many as ten talents determined by genes for the limited original apostles and their offsprings. Users may have the apostles breeding for rare apostles with advanced genetic variation.  [Learn more](/getting-started/game-entities/apostle).

**Education:** The apostle's talented ability allows each of them to have their right to work or fight and make him or her superb through education.

**Free Market:** In-game marketplace allows users to trade land/apostle/resources, hire workers, or even find your apostle's soulmate. All prices are determined by players driven by demand and supply. There's no price control anyway. You can even transfer your assets and trade on any third-party marketplaces.

**Career:** In addition to the miner's job that has already been launched, Evolution Land offers more career choices and corresponding social roles such as warrior, doctor, musician, etc. Each apostle can find his or her right place.

**Battle:** PvE, PvP, siege, group warfare, and the national war between the continents are about to be launched. If you have a love for blazing a trail, join the game to form your army.

**Play to Earn:** 70% of the game's revenue will be shared with the players; whether you are a KTON holder or active in construction, you can share its success. Even if you are playing the game for fun, you can win huge prizes through a transparent lottery.  [Learn more](/advanced/evolution-land-dao/revenue-model.md).

**DeFi:** Decentralized Finance is embedded in the gameplay everywhere. Your capital or effort invested in the game will earn you a reward. [Learn more](/advanced/furnace.md).

**Owned by Player:** Players truly own the game. Players may stake to obtain voting power that can allow them to drive the evolution by participating in the governance process and benefit from the dividents paid from game revenue.  [Learn more](/advanced/evolution-land-dao).

## Technical Features

**On-chain Game and Contract Operation:** Ownership of the game assets is confirmed by public blockchain technology. The players themselves own the identity accounts and game assets such as tokens and props. Almost the entire logic of the game is deployed on the blockchain in a contractual form. There is no need for players to worry about the common drawbacks of traditional games such as pulling strings, additional issuance, and plug-ins. The development team can't make shady deals.

**Cross-Chain Token Economy:** The world's first cross-chain token economy system with game scenes, different continents deployed on a different public chain, token, and assets can be exchanged in other continents through the Darwinia Network, constituting a free-market economy in a purely digital world.

**Decentralized Autonomy:** Evolution Land is designed to be a self-evolving, scalable, and open system. The players holding KTON have the right to vote on the continent's autonomous parameters and the right to speak in the direction of the game's evolution. All members of the DAO community will determine the game rules to enable the game itself to evolve on its own, ensuring that each user is both a player and a game designer.

**Open and Borderless:** With the open interfaces, SDK, and on-chain contracts of Evolution Land, any developer can easily build their own Dapp on the Evolution Land to integrate into the economic system and benefit from built-in referrals, sharing, and many other incentives. Simultaneously, traditional game assets, third-party Dapp, ERC721 assets, etc., can be seamlessly linked in. Evolution Land will evolve with the development of technology.
