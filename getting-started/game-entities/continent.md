# Continent

Evolution Land is logically divided into 26 continents, each of which is deployed on a different blockchain. Each continent will have around 2025 lands. Total resource reserves are determined randomly when a continent is created and will not change afterward.

Continents will evolve into a separate but related economic entity, somewhat like countries. In-game currency tokens, resources, and props shall be moved between continents as inter-continent trade, although the continent governance council may charge inter-continent trade tariffs. This inter-continent transaction is technically cross-chain transactions. Evolution Land will rely on Darwinia Network's Heterogeneous Cross Chain bridges to accomplish this.

To access each continent, you will need a proper toolset, such as wallets supporting the continent's underlying blockchain environment.

The continents will be launched one by one. Two continents exist today, they are: 

- **the [Atlantis](https://www.evolution.land/land/1)** (Ethereum) 
- **the [Byzantine](https://www.evolution.land/land/2)** (TRON)

New continents are being planned. These are the candidate blockchains that we are evaluating according to their **user base**, **dapp prosperity**, **smart contract compatibility,** and **gas fee**.
