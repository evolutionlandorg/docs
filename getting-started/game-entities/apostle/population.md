# Population

Breed brings about a population explosion, which affects scarcity and player demand and occupies limited resources \(traffic, labor market\), and lacks the Survival of the Fittest Model in Darwin's theory.

## Apostle's Life Span

Therefore, to achieve a balanced population economic model, the plague on the planet can help prevent population explosions. Although a magic potion can cure the sick, the resources of the magic potion are limited. Players can only choose to help the apostles that are more valuable. We divide the Apostle's life cycle into three stages:

* the pre-birth stage, 
* the natural life stage, 
* and the life continuation stage. 

When an Apostle was born, he was in the pre-birth stage. At this time, the life span of the Apostle did not enter the countdown. When the Apostle starts to perform any operations, including part-time work, breeding, etc., it will enter the natural life span. The life span trait in the Apostle's genes can also be understood as the life value, representing how long the Apostle can live. When its life is over, the player needs to decide whether to extend the Apostle's life.

During life, the Apostle needs to consume carbon and oxygen COO to maintain life. If carbon and oxygen are short, the Apostle will quickly enter a coma and interrupt the ongoing activities. Planetary Plagues exist all the time. When the Apostle's health expires, his immunity drops, and he cannot resist the plague on the Evolution Land. As a result, he cannot continue any work and enters a coma. Players can keep the Apostle in this state or send the Apostle to the "Incinerator" for destruction in exchange for a commemorative medal. There is a strange magic potion shop that sells magic potion. The magic potion can help the Apostle to come back from the coma and continue his life.

## Price of the Magic Potion

Weirdly, the magic potion shop does not decide the price. On the contrary, the price of this magical potion, `P`, is arbitrarily determined by the buyer. However, there is also a premise that the player must agree that anyone else can purchase the Apostle from at the price `P*(1/T )` even the the player is not willing to.

Therefore, the magic potion price cannot be set too low so that other players can compulsorily buy your Apostle, nor should it be set too high because it means you are wasting money on the magic potion. So, in the end, players will tend to buy magic potions only for those high-value Apostles at a reasonable price.

The magic potion shop may choose to distribute part of the income from the sale of magic potions to the living apostles to encourage the reproduction and birth of new apostles' lives.

## Haberge Tax Mode

This model is inspired by the Harberger Xax model, which introduces two concepts for how property ownership works: Citizens evaluate their property and pay taxes based on that price—self-assessment tax; Anyone can purchase your property at a price calculated based on the tax you pay. This will encourage citizens only to keep valuable assets and pay honest tax based on their real value.
