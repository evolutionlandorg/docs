# COO

COO is a highly-available resource like the oxygen we breathe. In the Evolution Land context, the [Apostle](https://github.com/evolutionlandorg/docs/tree/90295b4a91e285927629c8e3010a8f46ad7b22da/getting-started/game-entities/apostle.md) \(the player's in-game representative\) needs some COO to survive on the planet. Users can get the resource through some simple operations such as login into the game frequently. Many of the game's primary activities require only some COO, mainly for some players looking for fun or for those who come around to experience the game.
