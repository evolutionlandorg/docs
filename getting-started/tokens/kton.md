# KTON

## Usage

In Evolution Land, KTON is used as **a governance token**. Players can voluntarily lock their KTON into a governance contract \(minimum 14 days lock time\) to receive voting power. These voting power can vote for governance proposals within the continent to affect the evolution of the game. In return, these "governor" players will have the right to receive game **revenue dividends** \(30% of all revenue\), proportionally to their stake percentage of all locked KTONs.

In the game, some high-value Lands, high-rank buildings, and props are priced in KTON.

## Background of KTON

KTON is introduced on the Darwinia Network. It's a commitment token, a symbol of tokenized commitment, from the Darwinia Network's advanced staking system. It encourages RING holders to lock RING for a longer time in exchange for KTON, which can be used in the staking system. Staking rewards are split into two equal pools for RING and KTON stakers. Check out this [medium article](https://darwinianetwork.medium.com/darwinia-commitment-token-kton-861e2df1b4cb) to find out more about the design rationale of KTON.

Due to KTON holders' nature being the long-term investors or those who would pay a premium to obtain this commitment, this demographic is suitable to be candidates of Evolution Land governance participants.
