In the first version, there are two kinds of equipment launched — Sword for Swordsman and Shield for Suard.

**Sword:**

The swords could enhance the ATK ability and resource level.

**Shield:**

The shields could enhance the DEF ability and resource level.

More rare equipment will have a lower success rate to forge.

Equipment could be upgraded like drills. Every time you upgrade your equipment will bring one resource level enhancement.

**It will burn half of the resource tokens once you dismantle your equipment. Take consideration carefully before upgrading.**
