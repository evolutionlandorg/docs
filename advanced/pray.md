They represent gold, wood, water, fire, and earth spirits in turn. We will put 5 resource-rich lands and 250 Gen-0 apostles into their contracts, which is currently the only sales channel for resource-rich lands other than reward distribution.

Players can spend resources to pray to them. There are 2 types of prayers to choose from, corresponding to different winning rate.

| Type      | Rate of winning resource-rich land | Rate of winning Gen-0 apostle |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 10 Token  | 0.9%                               | 0.1%                          |
| 100 Token | 9%                                 | 1%                            |

When the resource-rich lands in the five elves‚Äô contracts are all acquired by the players, the list of the resource-rich land will be reset, and a new round of Pray will be started.

Players can wait for the notice after the draw to confirm your rewards.
