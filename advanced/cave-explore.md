# ðŸš© Cave Explore

Adventurers could start Cave Explore after locking the apostle team. (**Once confirmed, the team will be locked for 24 hours**)&#x20;

### How to participate

There is not enough COO for the apostle team to survive in the cave, so apostles must obtain enough COO in AFK mode for Cave Explore.

Once starting a new Cave Explore, the corresponding COO will be deducted from the user's account.

If you try to explore for several times in one day, it will cost double COO than last time.



### Monster and Rewards

There are 3 levels for the apostle team to conquer. There are 3 stages at each level. The final stage in each level is boss with the stronger ability and also, rare materials!
