# Evolution Land DAO

Evolution Land is designed and developed to be a DAO \(Decentralized Autonomous Organization\) owned by the community. Dev team's role is to kick off the project and establish the technical foundation so that other users \(players, designers, developers, investors\) can contribute and influence the game's evolution path in their way.

Decentralization is achieved through these means:

* **Technology** \([details](../../overview/developers.md)\)
  * Game logic exists on the blockchain, transparent and auditable. Open-source smart contracts
  * Open source front-end UI skeleton, anyone can clone and develop their UI
* **Revenue** \([details](revenue-model.md)\)
  * Game revenue is distributed to players and contributors, enforced by smart contracts
  * Built-in referral program
* **Governance** \([details](governance.md)\)
  * Distinguish casual players from the serious governors
  * Staked users have the power to vote for off-chain and on-chain proposals
